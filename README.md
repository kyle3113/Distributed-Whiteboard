Bio-story:

As a Computer Science graduate, I (with my team) put together a distrubted "Shared Whiteboard" on key principles for server client architecture and data flows. My part for the project consisted of full stack development with technologies: Java, JavaFX, Java Socket Programming, JSON. With the teams task-formation process, I jumped in first and developed the server client structure with an appropriate model for the distributed application. The team worked in stages on the framework that I had left and we continued development. The application served a whiteboard for  users could directly communicate In groups and draw with different editing tools. The web app used static typing to keep the whiteboard state for the user. The application used Java FX for system front end and graphics.
